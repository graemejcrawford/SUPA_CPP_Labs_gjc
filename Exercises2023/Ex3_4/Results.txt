Task 1:
The function that best matches the mystery data is the Cauchy-Lorentz function, with a peak location x_0 = 0 and scale parameter of gamma = 0.76

Task 2:
After adjusting the width of the gaussian to a standard deviation of 1.2, adjusting the number of samples to 10000 and the number of bins to 105, the sampled data 
from the Metropolis algorithm does a good job at overlaying the defined functions.

Task 3:

The value of pi calculated depends on the user input. 
As a test, I have run a radius of 1 and number of samples as 10000000 to obtain a value of 3.1419644000.
